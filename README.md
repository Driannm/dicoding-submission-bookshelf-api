## Project Description: Bookshelf APIðŸ“–
Bookshelf API is a simple backend project that allows users to manage their book collection efficiently through API. 
This project is designed to meet the submission criteria on the Dicoding platform with a focus on managing book data using HTTP methods. Here are the project details:

## Project Objective
This project aims to build a simple API with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for book data management. This API can be used to store, update, display, and delete book information effectively.

## Key Features
#### 1. Saving Books
- Users can add new books with attributes like name, year, author, summary, publisher, number of pages, and reading status.
- Additional properties like id, finished, insertedAt, and updatedAt are automatically generated by the server.
  
#### 2. Showing All Books
- The API provides an endpoint to display the list of saved books.
- Only displays id, name, and publisher properties for efficiency.

#### 3. Showing Book Details
- Users can retrieve complete details of a particular book based on its ID.

#### 4. Updating Book Data
- Existing books can be updated based on their ID. Validation is applied to ensure data integrity.

#### 5. Deleting Books
- Books can be deleted based on their ID. Response is given if ID is not found.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js** as runtime environment.
- **Hapi.js** or other HTTP library to build API server.
- **Nanoid** to generate unique ID.
- **npm** for package management and running scripts.

## API Endpoints
#### POST /books
Adds a new book to the system.

#### GET /books
Displays a list of all stored books.

#### GET /books/{bookId}
Displays details of a specific book based on ID.

#### PUT /books/{bookId}
Updates book data based on ID.

#### DELETE /books/{bookId}
Deletes a book from the system based on ID.

## Server Validation and Response
- **Input Validation**
  - The `name` property is required.
  - The `readPage` property cannot be greater than `pageCount`.
- **Response**
  - The server provides a response based on the operation status, including an informative error message if a failure occurs.
